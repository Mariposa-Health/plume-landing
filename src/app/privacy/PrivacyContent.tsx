      <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
      <p>
        We also may use automated data collection technologies to collect information about your
        online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services
        (behavioral tracking). Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and
        online services indicating a preference that they &quot;do not track&quot; your online
        activities. At this time, we do not honor such signals, and we do not modify what
        information we collect or how we use that information based upon whether such a signal is
        broadcast or received by us.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Data from accidental loss and
        from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We use encryption technology for
        information sent and received by us, and we require that all users create password encrypted
        accounts with two factor authentication enabled. The safety and security of your information
        also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for the use of our Website, you are
        responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password
